## Running Jupyter Locally via Docker

We've shared a Docker Compose template, to make sure you can run all of these notebooks in your own time, on your own machine.

You will need to have Docker installed on your system to create images and run containers. You can find the installation steps for all platforms on the company's [website](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
.

1) Clone the repository for the class either using the UI or your terminal (see above).

2) Once you have Docker installed, type the following on your terminal: `docker-compose up`

3) Head to `localhost:8888` in your browser and you will be able to access the Jupyter Notebooks.
